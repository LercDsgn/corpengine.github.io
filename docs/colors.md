# CORP Engine Colors


* Colors in CORP are constants in the `main.Colors` module, thus you can access each color with `corpengine1.Colors.{COLOR}.`
* Each color is defined as a **tuple** following the pattern `(RED, GREEN, BLUE)`, having a length of **3**, each item being an integer between 0 and 255 (both inclusive) representing the intesity of the corresponding color.
