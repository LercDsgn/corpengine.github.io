# Objects Documentation

* Objects are used in classes. They are used in services & object types.

All GameObjects have this attributes:
1. name (the string used to access objects by the user)
2. type (engine use only, don't change this!)
3. parent (the parent object)

## Object Types
- There are some built-in object types that you can use to make a player, draw text, create particles and more.
